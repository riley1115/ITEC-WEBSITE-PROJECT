                <p>DUBAI (United Arab Emirates) - Ulaanbaatar Xac came alive in the second half to show Meralco the door, 83-78, and barge into the BCL Asia 2025 Semi-Finals, Wednesday at the Coca-Cola Arena.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Broncos flipped an eight-point deficit late in the third quarter and went on to lead by as many as 11 before needing to ward off the Bolts' comeback on the way to ensuring that their magical run continues.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>A squad defined by breakthroughs this season, the BCL Asia-East 2025 champions have become the first-ever team from Mongolia to reach the said stage in the continent's most prestigious club competition.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>"I'm really happy to be part of this Broncos club," expressed head coach Ariunbold Erdene. "We have been working so hard every day, and this is the result of the past couple of years of our hard work."</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Ian Miller time and again presided over the triumph, finishing with a game-high 32 points alongside 3 rebounds, and 6 assists as the crafty guard bannered their massive turnaround after the halftime intermission.</p>
                <br>
                <p>He helped put together and cap off a crucial 13-0 scoring spree toward a 61-55 lead in the third and they would remain in the driver's seat, before leading another huge assault early in the deciding chapter.</p>
