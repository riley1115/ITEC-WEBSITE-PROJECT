                    <br> opponent in Ilkley Open</h1>

                <p>Alex Eala took a step towards qualification to the main draw of the 2025 Nottingham Open after a three-set win over Varvara Gracheva, Saturday in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Eala recovered from a letdown in the second set to eliminate Gracheva, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She will now need to defeat Anca Todoni of Romania to earn one of the six qualifying spots to the main draw.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's a bounce back win for Eala, who had just lost to Canada's Rebecca Marino in the quarterfinals of the Ilkley Open on Thursday</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Filipina broke Gracheva's serve for a 5-2 advantage, but was broken right back as the Russian player stayed alive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Eala kept her composure, however, and broke back in the next game to seal the victory. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            Todoni, currently ranked 88th by the WTA, had swept home bet Jodie Burrage 7-6 (7-2), 6-1, in an earlier match to progress.</p>
