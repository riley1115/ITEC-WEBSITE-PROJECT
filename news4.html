            </aside>

                <p>Duane “Kelra” Pillas may be hailed as the god of the gold lane, but on Sunday, he proved that even legends make mistakes — owning up to a costly misplay that may have turned the tide of the series.</p>

                <p>In Game 7 of the MPL Philippines Grand Finals, Team Liquid PH was advancing toward ONIC Philippines’ base when Kelra spotted an opportunity to burst down eventual Finals MVP Alston “Sanji” Pabico. Hoping to spark a momentum-shifting play, he dove in.</p>
                
                <p>But instead of turning the tide, he was punished. ONIC quickly collapsed on him, snuffing out the attempt and decimating Team Liquid PH’s final push. ONIC secured the championship moments later.</p>
                
                <p>Kelra didn’t shy away from the blame. He faced the moment head-on, taking full responsibility for the fateful decision.</p>
                
                <p>“Kaya ko pinasok ‘yun kasi nakita ko yung opportunity na kaya ko eh, pero hindi pala. Dito kasi sa ML, kailangan niyo talagang gumawa nang gumawa ng play lalo na pag lugi kayo eh,” said a visibly emotional Kelra, explaining the thought process behind the play.</p>
                
                <p>“Di niyo naman malalaman kung tama or mali yung play hangga’t hindi niyo ginagawa yung play. Ayun, nagkamali ako nung last play.”</p>
                
                <p>The sting of defeat was evident within the ONIC camp. Tears flowed — proof of how much the loss meant to them.</p>
                
                <p>ONIC had been on a dominant streak since clinching the M6 World Championship last December, winning every international tournament they entered in 2024. For Kelra and his teammates, this was unfamiliar ground.</p>
                
                <p>“Sobrang magiging motivation ko ‘to kasi ngayon lang ulit kami nakaranas ng talo sa lahat ng tournament na nasasalihan namin eh. Mas nagiging mainit kaming lima,” the ONIC gold laner declared.</p>
